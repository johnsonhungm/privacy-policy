# Privacy Policy — Privacy Veil Extension

This extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. 
All text anonymization occurs entirely on the user’s local device. The extension 
does not send data to external servers, does not use analytics, and does not 
track browsing history.

Only non-personal configuration preferences may be stored locally.
